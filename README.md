Some years ago, I finally took a short course on Web Development. It was the basics: Using HTML and CSS and only a teeny-tiny amount of Javascript to create a basic four-page website. 
I am an instructional designer and learning technologist who occasionally needs to style the LMS and pages.
Most of what I know is self-taught, so my code will be sloppy and beginner-ish.
